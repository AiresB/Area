## Computer language used

Dart (Flutter)

## How I programmed

I developed with visual studio code using my phone to test the code.

## How can you run it ?

* You need to install the SDK android (I give you the link, I'm gentle : https://developer.android.com/studio)

* You have to create a phone simulator on your computer (I'll give you another link back, look how nice I am : https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds)

* If you prefer to launch it on your phone, you must activate the developer mode of your device. 

* You must install Flutter to be able to launch the application (Oh look, another link, I'm definitely too nice : https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

* Launch your simulator (or plug in your mobile device with PTP protocol)

* Go to your favorite terminal, and do the following command : *flutter doctor*

* If you see that something is wrong (device not recognized, SDK not found, or other), I'll let you look on the internet (sorry I can't send you another link ...)

* After all that, you can go to the root of the folder, and type the following command to launch the application : *flutter run*

* And enjoy !
